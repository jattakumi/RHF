# RHF
A python code for calculating the HF energy for Hydrogen molecule at the 3-21G basis set.
This block code, calculates the integrals(kinetic, electron-electron repulsion, electron-nuclear, nuclear-nuclear and the overlap) we need to compute the HF energy for the hydrogen molecule. Also, performing a geometry optimization using the Newton-Raphson method.
There is a slight bug in the code, which deviates computed parameters such as bond dissociation energy, bond length, harmonic vibrational frequency and geometry optimization for that reported by literature.
